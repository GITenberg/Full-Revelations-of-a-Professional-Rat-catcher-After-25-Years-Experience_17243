description: Today, many city-dwellers regard rats as an unavoidable nuisance, but
  in nineteenth-century England, they were a far more dangerous and pervasive problem.
  This fascinating volume, penned by one of the UK's foremost rat exterminators, is
  a cross between a how-to manual and an autobiography. Those with an interest in
  the dark underbelly of Victorian life will relish this quirky page-turner.
