<h2><!-- page 2--><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Introduction.</h2>
<p>In placing before my readers in the following pages the results of
my twenty-five years&rsquo; experience of Rat-catching, Ferreting, etc.,
I may say that I have always done my best to accomplish every task that
I have undertaken, and I have in consequence received excellent testimonials
from many corporations, railway companies, and merchants.&nbsp; I have
not only made it my study to discover the different and the best methods
of catching Rats, but I have also taken great interest in watching their
ways and habits, and I come to the conclusion that there is no sure
way of completely exterminating the Rodents, especially in large towns.&nbsp;
If I have in this work referred more particularly to Rat-catching in
Manchester that is only because my experience, although extending over
a much wider area, has been chiefly in that city, but the methods I
describe are equally applicable to all large towns.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>IKE MATTHEWS.</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL RAT-CATCHER,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PENDLETON,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MANCHESTER.</p>
<h2><!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>PART I.&nbsp; HOW
TO CLEAR RATS FROM WAREHOUSES, OFFICES, STOREROOMS, ETC.</h2>
<p>In the first place my advice is&mdash;never poison Rats in any enclosed
buildings whatever.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Simply because the Rats that you
poison are Drain Rats, or what you call Black Rats, and you can depend
upon it that the Rats that you poison will not get back into the drains,
but die under the floor between the laths and plaster, and the consequence
is that in a few days the stench that will arise will be most obnoxious.&nbsp;
And there is nothing more injurious than the smell of a decomposed Rat.</p>
<p>Having had a long experience in Manchester I am quite sure of this.&nbsp;
As an instance, I remember a private house where I was engaged catching
Rats under a floor with ferrets.&nbsp; I went as far as possible on
my belly under the floor with two candles in my hands, and I saw <!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the
ferret kill a large bitch Rat, about six yards from me against a wall,
where neither the dog nor myself could get at it.&nbsp; I finished the
job and made out my bill for my services, but in about two or three
weeks after they again sent for me, declaring they could not stay in
the sitting-room on account of the smell that arose from beneath the
flooring boards.&nbsp; They had in consequence to send for a joiner;
and as I knew the exact spot where the Rat was killed I ordered him
to take up the floor boards just where the dead Rat lay, and the stench
that arose from the decomposed Rodent was bad in the extreme.&nbsp;
I disinfected the place, and I was never sent for again.&nbsp; This
was under a cold floor, and it is much worse where there is any heat.</p>
<p>Now to deal with the different methods of catching Rats.&nbsp; The
best way, in my opinion, is,</p>
<h3>TRAPPING THEM WITH STEEL SPRING TRAPS.</h3>
<p>Whenever you are trapping, never on any consideration put bait on
the traps; always put traps in their runs, but you will find Rats are
so cunning that in time, after a few have been caught, they will jump
over the traps, and then you must try another way.&nbsp; A good one
is the following, viz.:&mdash;Get a bag of fine, clean sawdust, and
mix with it about one-sixth its weight of oatmeal.&nbsp; Obtain the
sawdust <!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>fresh from under
the saw, without bits of stick in, as these would be liable to get into
the teeth of the trap and stop them from closing.&nbsp; Where you see
the runs put a handful in say about 30 different places, every night,
just dropping the sawdust and meal out of your hands in little heaps.&nbsp;
That means 30 different heaps.&nbsp; Do this for four nights, and you
will see each morning that the sawdust is all spread about.&nbsp; Now
for four more nights you must bury a set trap under every heap of sawdust.&nbsp;
Thus you will have 30 traps, on each of which there is a square centre
plate; you must level the sawdust over the plate with a bit of stick,
and set each trap as fine as you can on the catch spring, so that the
weight of a mouse would set it off.&nbsp; They will play in the sawdust
as usual, and you will have Rats in almost every trap.&nbsp; You will
find that this plan will capture a great many of the Rodents.&nbsp;
I have trapped as many as 114 in one night in this way.</p>
<p>In time, however, the Rats will cease to go near sawdust.&nbsp; Then
you must procure a bag of fine soot from any chimney sweep, and you
will find that they will go at the soot just as keen as they did in
the first instance at the sawdust.&nbsp; When they get tired of soot
(which <!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>they will in time)
you must procure some soft tissue paper and cut it fine, and use that
in the same way as the sawdust and the soot.&nbsp; You can also use
light chaff or hay seeds with the like result.</p>
<p>I must not omit to tell my readers to always trap Rats in the night,
and to go very quietly about it, for if you make much noise they will
give over feeding.&nbsp; You must not go about with too big a light
whilst trapping.&nbsp; You should stay at the building from dark until
midnight, and every time a Rat is caught in the trap you should go with
a bull&rsquo;s eye lamp, take it out of the trap or kill it, and then
set the trap again, as you have the chance of another Rat in the same
trap.&nbsp; From experience I can say that you need not stay in any
place after 12 o&rsquo;clock at night, as I think that the first feed
is the best, and that the first three hours are worth all the other
part of the night.&nbsp; You can go home at 12 o&rsquo;clock, and be
sure to be in the place by 6 or 7 a.m., for many a Rat caught in the
trap by the front leg will, if it gets time, eat off its leg and get
away again, and they are very cunning to catch afterwards.</p>
<h3>NEVER HAVE YOUR TRAPS SET IN THE DAYTIME.</h3>
<p>Handle them as little as possible.&nbsp; Always catch as many Rats
as you can in your <!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>buildings
in January and February, as they begin to breed in March, and every
bitch Rat means, on the average, eight more.&nbsp; Also get as much
ferreting done as possible before breeding time, for a young Rat can
get into the ends of the joisting under a floor, where a ferret cannot
get near it, and the consequence is that a ferret is unable to cope
with its task.&nbsp; The best thing I can advise for clearing young
Rats is a good cat, one that must not be handled nor made a pet of,
but allowed to live in almost a wild state.&nbsp; A good cat can do
as much, in my opinion, in one night, when Rats are breeding, as two
ferrets can do in a day, especially in a building where there are cavity
walls, as it is impossible for a ferret to follow a Rat in such walls.</p>
<p>This is all the information I am able to give on the trapping of
Rats&mdash;a method I have proved by 25 years&rsquo; experience to excel
all others.&nbsp; Still another way of clearing the pests is as follows:&mdash;The
majority of Rats are Black, or what we call Drain Rats; if they are
in a building they will in most cases come from a water-closet.&nbsp;
Sometimes you will see from the drain pipes in the water-closet, say,
a six-inch pipe fitted into a nine-inch pipe, and the joint covered
round with clay, through which the Rats eat and scratch and get into
<!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the building in great
numbers in the night, but most of them return into the drains during
the day.&nbsp; Now, if it is the breeding season (about eight months
out of the twelve) they will do much damage to silk, cotton, leather,
lace, and, in fact, all other light goods.&nbsp; And one would be surprised
to see the quantity of cloth, paper, etc., they will procure for their
nests whilst breeding.</p>
<p>The way to get clear of these is to go in the day with two or three
ferrets and leave the drain pipe open.&nbsp; Ferret them all back into
the drain; don&rsquo;t put a net over the drain for fear you might miss
one or two.&nbsp; If they got back into the building they would be hard
to catch, as they would not face the net again.&nbsp; Then, after ferreting,
make the drain good, and if there be an odd Rat or two left in the building
you will get them in a few nights by baiting the trap.</p>
<p>There is another way of catching the Brown Rat which breeds under
the floor in large buildings where there are no drains.&nbsp; They are
very awkward to catch.&nbsp; Always have a trap or two set, but do not
set them where they feed; place them in their runs.&nbsp; But there
are other methods for other Rat-infested places.&nbsp; For instance,
take a restaurant, where they feed in the cooking <!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>kitchen;
we will suppose they have eaten four holes through either floor or skirting
boards.&nbsp; The best way to catch these&mdash;however many holes they
have leading into the kitchen&mdash;is to block up (with tin or similar
material) all the holes with the exception of one, and let them use
that one for two nights.&nbsp; Then put a plateful of good food, such
as oatmeal and oil of aniseed, as far from the hole as you can in the
same kitchen; then run a small train of meal and aniseed from the hole
to the plate.&nbsp; Next drive two six-inch nails in the wall, with
a long piece of string tied to the nail heads.&nbsp; Put on these nails
a brick or piece of board right above the hole 2 inches up the wall.&nbsp;
Be sure the nails are quite loose in the wall over the hole, and leave
in that position for two nights, so that the Rats will get used to it.&nbsp;
On the night that you are going to catch them, before leaving the place
carry the string from the nail heads to the door or window; let the
door or window be closed within an inch, with the end of the string
outside.&nbsp; After the place has been quiet for thirty minutes return
to the door or window very quietly, and you will hear the Rats feeding.&nbsp;
Pull the string, the loose nails come out of the wall and the brick
or board drops over the hole.&nbsp; You can then go in, close the door,
turn up the gas and <!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>catch
or kill them at your leisure, as they cannot get back again.</p>
<p>By this method I may mention that I have caught a great number of
Rats, and it is quite possible to clear a place in this manner: that
is, if they do not come out of the drains.&nbsp; I have caught upwards
of 103 in six nights in this way.&nbsp; The best time to catch Rats
in any building is always at night, and always about half-an-hour after
the place has been closed, as Rats are generally more adventurous to
come for their first feed.&nbsp; Always go about as quietly as possible.</p>
<p>In some of the very old Manchester buildings that were built in the
days before drain plans had to be submitted to the corporation, one
finds under the cellar floors old-fashioned brick and flag drains (better
known as &ldquo;spit&rdquo; drains), that were left in when the place
was built.&nbsp; Once the Rats get in these disused drains all the professional
Rat-catchers in England could not clear them without pulling the building
down.&nbsp; The Rats have, by some means, got out of the main sewer,
probably by the bursting of a sewer into one of these disused dry brick
drains.&nbsp; It is then impossible to get underground to see where
they have got into the dry drain, and the only thing that can be done
in a case of this sort is to engage a <!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>professional
Rat-catcher occasionally, and keep two or three good cats to keep the
Rats down.&nbsp; These places as a rule are more plagued with them when
it is very wet weather and there are floods running.&nbsp; This is the
best time to catch them, as they are all under the floor of the building,
and are very easy to catch in the night with the traps.</p>
<p>As a rule the Black or Drain Rats feed only in the night, very rarely
in the day, as they are of a dirty nature, and prefer being in the drains.&nbsp;
In my opinion the Black Rat is more vicious than the Brown.</p>
<p>There is another Rat I call the Red Rat, which is akin to the Brown
Rat.&nbsp; You will always catch these at a tannery, or about kennels,
where hounds are kept, and they generally feed on horseflesh or offal.&nbsp;
Red Rats are the &ldquo;gameist&rdquo; Rats I know, for whatever kind
of Rats are put into the store cage, these Red Rats kill them the first
night they are left quiet.</p>
<p>I may describe another mode of catching Rats.&nbsp; In any Rat-overrun
warehouse, storeroom, or cellar, where there is a deal of rubbish such
as packing cases, wrappers, waste paper, etc., throw a lot of food,
say oatmeal or soaked bread, carelessly amongst the cases or rubbish
and let the Rats have a full week&rsquo;s feeding at <!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>their
leisure, and then if you know the holes round the floor wherefrom they
come, go in some night as quick as possible, turn up the lights, run
to the three or four holes, and block them up with pieces of rag, etc.&nbsp;
Now as all the Rats will not run out of the packing cases or waste paper,
but will hide amongst the same, this is the time to take a good terrier
dog or two with you, and to have a bit of sport.&nbsp; Let one dog hunt
among the cases, etc., and hold the other, for the Rats will soon make
for the holes, but the rags preventing their escape you will catch and
kill a great many by this means.</p>
<p>It should be stated here that as Rats are very cunning, it takes
a lot of study, dodging, and experience to be able to rid them entirely.&nbsp;
When you are feeding Rats anywhere, never feed them with other than
soft stuff, which you can squeeze through your fingers, for if you feed
them with anything lumpy, they will carry pieces into their holes and
eat at their leisure.</p>
<h3>FERRETING.</h3>
<p>Ferreting is a very good plan for destroying Rats in cottage houses,
stables, hotels, etc., as it can be done in the day, but in buildings,
say five or six storeys high you cannot ferret very well as you cannot
tell where to set your nets.&nbsp; The only way to ferret a large building
is to ferret one floor at once, and always start at the <!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>top
storey first.&nbsp; The majority of floors are laths and plaster.&nbsp;
This is what the Rat likes, especially the Brown Rat, and there are
more nests found in these places than anywhere else.&nbsp; To ferret
thoroughly in such places you will require to have a board up at each
end of the floor: the two end boards that run crossways with the joist;
then you must have a man to put the ferret in at one end, and ferret
one joist at a time; have a net set at the other end.&nbsp; The best
way at the catching end is to have a long sheet net about a yard wide,
and the full length of the boards that are up, for sometimes under the
boards the Rats can get out of one joist into another, and if you use
the long net you can catch them whichever joist they bolt at.</p>
<p>Now we will suppose you are ferreting a seven-storey building, which
might occupy three or four days.&nbsp; If you have ferreted two stories
the first day, during the night the Rats that have not been ferreted
on the lower stories may get back again to the top storey.</p>
<p>How to prevent this happening I will give you a plan of my own, which
I don&rsquo;t think any Rat-catcher but myself has ever employed.&nbsp;
The course of action&mdash;a rather expensive one I admit&mdash;is the
following: While you have the boards up you must go to the druggist
and get two shillings&rsquo; worth of cayenne pepper, and put <!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>it
into a pepper duster.&nbsp; Scatter the cayenne along the boards and
joist where you have had the long sheet net, and also along the other
end of the joist where you put the ferrets in, and you will find that
under no consideration will Rats face the cayenne pepper.&nbsp; Cayenne
is alright for any dry place and will last a long time, but it will
not do in any water closets or any damp places, as dampness takes all
the nature out of the cayenne.</p>
<p>After ferreting in any kind of building, always go carefully round
the outside, and see that there are no broken air grids, or broken cellar
windows, as these are likely ways that the Rats get into the building
at first.&nbsp; When ferreting always be careful how you set your nets,
and be extremely quick on the Rats when they bolt, for sometimes if
they get back they will face the ferret before they will bolt again;
then the ferrets kill them under the floors, and this as in the case
of poisoning them is liable to cause an abominable smell, more especially
where heat is near.</p>
<p>In the whole of my experience of Rat-catching, which is a lengthy
one, I never gave a guarantee to clear a place completely, in Manchester
or any other town where so many large buildings are so close together.&nbsp;
And let me show the reason for this.&nbsp; Take Cannon <!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Street,
Manchester, as an illustration.&nbsp; Here are six or eight different
firms in one block of buildings.&nbsp; Now, suppose four of these firms
are suffering from the damage the Rats are doing.&nbsp; Well, one or
two of these firms may go to the expense of having the Rats cleared
away.&nbsp; But between the two buildings there may be a hardware business
or ironmonger&rsquo;s shop, where Rats cannot do any harm to their goods.&nbsp;
The owners of these shops will not go to the expense of having Rats
caught, nor will they let us go into their shops at midnight; therefore
the result is the Rat-catcher in his trapping and ferreting is limited
to these two places, and all he can do is to catch some and drive the
rest into the hardware shop.&nbsp; When under the floors in such places
one finds there has been so many alterations made at different times
that one joist may be a foot or six inches below the other, and when
the Rats are completely driven out of these places it would require
joiners and bricksetters to work for weeks under the floors to stop
the Rats returning.&nbsp; And most firms will not go to this expense.&nbsp;
I only give my readers this as an illustration of what has often happened
with me, and to show why I never guarantee to clear Rats completely
in large towns.&nbsp; If they are in a private house, stable, greenhouse,
or any block <!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of houses,
of say five or six, I might then, after looking through, give a guarantee
to clear them completely.</p>
<p>These are the fullest details I can give you, and if you will put
any of the ways I have mentioned into practice you will find that they
are all successful, especially the covering of traps.&nbsp; I can give
you just one more instance in Manchester, where I was engaged.&nbsp;
The workpeople had been tormenting the Rats with traps, not knowing
how to set them.&nbsp; They sent for me, and on my looking round the
place I knew there was a lot of Rats.&nbsp; I submitted my price to
do the job, and when I went down one night with 40 traps, dog, and two
ferrets I thought I should catch 20 or 30 Rats, but I found that they
had plagued them so much with their attempted trapping that I only caught
three in the whole night.&nbsp; This place belonged to a limited company,
and when I went before the committee the next morning they were not
satisfied.&nbsp; I told them that their own workpeople had tormented
the Rats so much with traps that the Rats would not go near one.&nbsp;
I then told the committee that I would still stick to my terms, but
I would leave the job over for a fortnight.&nbsp; Now during that fortnight
I went down a good many times, and laid the sawdust as I have <!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>already
described, and thus got the Rats used to it.&nbsp; The first night that
I went catching I took with me 33 traps.&nbsp; I had them all set by
8-30 p.m., and by 12-30 a.m. I had trapped 45 Rats; the next night 31
Rats; and before I completed the job, with the trapping and the other
ways that I have mentioned, I caught 183 Rats!&nbsp; This I give merely
as an illustration to show the necessity of engaging an experienced
man to catch Rats&mdash;that is, if you want them caught.&nbsp; And
to confirm the statements above, I shall be most happy to supply privately
the name and place of the firm, and also to give a personal interview
if necessary.</p>
<p>And now a word or two respecting the different ways in which Rat-catchers
are treated.&nbsp; Many people think that a Rat-catcher is favoured
if they give him permission to catch Rats on their farms or round the
banks of their corn or wheat fields.&nbsp; Well, on some occasions I
grant this may be a favour, for I have seen when I have had an order
in hand for about 10 dozen Rats, and have had only a day or two in which
to get them.&nbsp; Such are the only times and circumstances when a
Rat-catcher gives his services gratis, and simply because he wants the
live Rats.&nbsp; Most farmers will send you word when they are <!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>threshing
their corn, and then the value of the Rats are worth the day&rsquo;s
work to the Rat-catcher.</p>
<p>This is all right as far as it goes, but when one comes to consider
the yearly expenses of the Rat-catcher it will be found that they are
very heavy.&nbsp; Now, first of all it will cost, at the least, &pound;5
annually for the wear and tear of traps alone, then there is the wear
and tear of nets; two dog licences; always three or four ferrets to
keep (and ferrets are often lost down drains or killed by Rats); also
sundry other expenses, such as store cages, etc.&nbsp; Then, again,
the Rat-catcher always has to pay a man to help him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call Rat-catching a trade only: I maintain that it
is a profession, and one that requires much learning and courage.&nbsp;
I have found this out when I have been under a warehouse floor, where
a lot of Rats were in the traps, and I could not get one man out of
50 to come under the floor and hold the candle for me, not to mention
helping me to take the live Rats out of the traps.&nbsp; I just relate
this because at some places where we go and where we catch perhaps 30
Rats, the first thing they say when the bill is presented is &ldquo;Why,
you have got 15s. worth of live Rats!&rdquo;&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
think of the damage 30 Rats can do <!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to
fancy goods, nor do they consider the evil smells that men have to tolerate
under the floors or from the bad drains.</p>
<p>I could relate many interesting anecdotes of what I have seen and
heard about Rats, but I fear its perusal might take up too much of my
readers&rsquo; time.&nbsp; There is, however, one thing I will mention.&nbsp;
I dare say you have heard of Rats running about in &ldquo;swarms&rdquo;
in the night.&nbsp; Do not believe it.&nbsp; In my whole experience
I have never been so fortunate as to meet a &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; of these,
when I have had an empty cage on my back, and an order for 12 dozen
live Rats at 5s. per dozen.&nbsp; When trapping at farms on a moonlight
night I have seen a train of Rats almost in single file going from a
barn to a pit or brook to drink, and then I have simply run a long net
all along the barn very quickly, sent my dog round the pit and caught
all the Rats in the net when they ran back to get in the barn.&nbsp;
For in these places you must be as cunning as the Rats to catch them.&nbsp;
The quickest way for a farmer to get rid of Rats is to run a long trail
of good oatmeal outside his barn doors, and shoot them on a moonlight
night.&nbsp; I have seen 11 killed at a shot in this way.&nbsp; They
will stay eating the oatmeal because they cannot carry it away.&nbsp;
At farms or out-houses you might <!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>poison
Rats round a pit or along brook sides where they go to drink, although
I don&rsquo;t believe in poisoning, as one never knows where it ends&mdash;the
Rats being likely to carry the poisoned food about, and then dogs, hens,
pigs, pigeons, etc., may pick it up.</p>
<p>There may be a few more ways of catching Rats than I have enumerated,
but I think I have given the best ways in detail.&nbsp; Some people
think that to use</p>
<h3>THE MONGOOSE</h3>
<p>is very good, but I think that the mongoose is no better than a good
fox terrier dog or a good cat, the only advantage in the mongoose being
that all the Rats it kills it will bring back dead to its habitation,
and that stops the dead Rats from smelling under the floors.&nbsp; I
think that the mongoose is not half so sly or sharp as a good cat, and
a mongoose, moreover, has to be taught how to kill a Rat (just the same
as a dog).&nbsp; I am fortunate in having actually seen a mongoose and
a Rat put alive in a tub together, and the mongoose would not even look
at the Rat.&nbsp; And I maintain that the mongoose cannot compare with
the ferret anytime, for the simple reason that a small ferret can get
anywhere that a Rat can, whilst the mongoose must wait until the Rat
comes out to feed.&nbsp; For instance, if a board <!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of
a floor be left up for a mongoose to get under the floor, it can only
get into one of the joists; but a ferret can follow a Rat wherever it
goes.&nbsp; Then again, the Rats can smell a mongoose even more strongly
than they can smell a cat.&nbsp; So these facts prevent my recommending
a mongoose on any account.&nbsp; I have also heard of people experimenting
with different sorts of</p>
<h3>DRUGS AND CHEMICALS</h3>
<p>for enticing Rats out of their holes.&nbsp; I hope none of my readers
will be attracted with this device.&nbsp; I hold that there is nothing
that will tempt a Rat from its hole like hunger.&nbsp; The nearest approach
that I have found to entice the Rodent out of its hole is oil of aniseed
or oil of rhodium, but the latter is expensive.&nbsp; I can rely best
on oil of aniseed, because I have often successfully tried it in experiment
upon the plate of a set trap.&nbsp; I have placed only three or four
drops of oil of aniseed upon the plate of a set trap without bait, and
often the trap has closed and trapped the Rat by the nose; so that it
will be seen that the Rat must have been licking the plate, or it could
not be caught in that manner.&nbsp; I have also frequently noticed when
I have set, say, 20 traps covered with meal and sawdust mixed, that
if I have put only two drops of oil of aniseed on half the <!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>traps
I should find next morning on looking at the traps that most Rats are
in those in which I had placed the aniseed.&nbsp; I think that oil of
rhodium and oil of aniseed are very good to drop on the traps after
setting, or to mix with the stuff with which the traps are covered.</p>
<p>There is also another way of bolting Rats.&nbsp; Sometimes when the
ferret is put under a boarded floor, all the Rats will run together
and pack themselves in a heap at the end of a joist.&nbsp; When the
Rats pack themselves on each other thus, the ferret on reaching them
will tackle only one at a time.&nbsp; You can always tell when this
happens by the ferret working a long time and bolting no Rats.&nbsp;
Now, immediately you notice this, put your mouth near the hole where
you have put the ferrets in, and make a squealing noise with your mouth
to imitate a squealing Rat.&nbsp; This causes the heap of Rats at the
end of the joist to disperse through fear, and when they get running
about they will bolt into the net.&nbsp; Many times I have not had a
bolt for half-an-hour and when I have squealed at the hole I have had
four or five Rats in the nets at once.</p>
<p>These are some of the methods of clearing Rats from various places,
and from experience I think they excel all others.</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>PART II.&nbsp;
HOW TO KEEP AND WORK FERRETS.</h2>
<p>The first necessity in ferret-keeping is that they shall be kept
in hutches or &ldquo;cotes,&rdquo; as they are commonly called.&nbsp;
Care must always be taken to have their places well swilled with carbolic
water, and then allowed to thoroughly dry before whitewashing the inside,
which is also essential to keep them healthy.&nbsp; This should be done
at least four times a year.&nbsp; Always have your hutches leaning from
the wall, so that wet or refuse will not lodge, for when the bottom
of a hutch is always wet it is liable to give the ferrets a disease
called foot rot, which is very frequent where ferrets are neglected.&nbsp;
Always keep the feeding part of the hutch well covered with sawdust.</p>
<p>In feeding ferrets for the purpose of Rat-catching, never do so before
going out with them; I think it is quite sufficient to feed them every
24 hours.&nbsp; If you feed them oftener they are liable to get too
fat, and also lazy and unwilling to work as they should.&nbsp; The best
food you can give them is bread and <!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>milk,
and occasionally a little raw liver.&nbsp; Mix the bread and milk with
a little hot water, stir well with a spoon or squeeze through your fingers,
so that the ferrets will have to eat it where you feed them; if not
they will carry the large pieces of bread that are wet into the corners
of the sleeping place, which would soon cause that part of the hutch
to smell very sour and become injurious to the health of the ferret,
especially where four or five are kept together, as they are of a very
perspiring nature.&nbsp; Always give them plenty of room to run about
when you can; if you don&rsquo;t they are likely to take cramp.</p>
<p>Ferrets are usually subject to distemper.&nbsp; The first symptom
is the ferret&rsquo;s neglect of its food.&nbsp; When you see this you
will observe a little matter at the corner of the eyes, and the ferret
will have a slight running at the nostrils.&nbsp; Immediately you see
these symptoms separate that ferret from the others, as this is, I think,
the worst disease one has to contend with.</p>
<p>In the whole of my ferret-keeping experience I have found distemper,
if caught in time, can be cured; but if it gets too far I know of no
cure for it.&nbsp; I have known a gamekeeper to have dogs with the distemper,
and he has not touched his ferrets or handled them at all <!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>during
the time his dogs were bad, yet a week afterwards his ferrets caught
the disease.&nbsp; He tried all the remedies he knew of, but in 14 days
12 hitherto good, strong, healthy ferrets died: all he had.&nbsp; This
will show at once that the disease is very contagious.&nbsp; The moment
you see signs of distemper coming on feed the ferret as little as possible.&nbsp;
Give it as little to eat as will just keep life in it, for in feeding
the ferret you also feed the disease.&nbsp; When you have kept the food
from it is the time to start curing if possible.&nbsp; Now, from experience
the first thing I recommend is to sweat the disease out of it, and I
find the best way to do this is as follows:&mdash;Get an old bucket
with a few one-inch holes bored in the bottom, and almost fill it with
good new straw horse-droppings; put a little hay on the top of the droppings,
and then put the ferret on the hay.&nbsp; Place or hang the bucket over
a boiler or on the mantelpiece, and let the kettle steam under the bucket,
say for 30 minutes, and you will find the steam and the ammonia from
the droppings will together sweat the disease out of the ferret; then
you can start feeding it again.&nbsp; Feed it with something substantial,
such as the jelly from stewed cowheels; give them the jelly only, not
the meat; and you will have a good result.&nbsp; Also give them a <!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>teaspoonful
of cream.&nbsp; This is the one and only cure for distemper.</p>
<p>Another disease in ferrets, especially young ones, is what I call
&ldquo;red mange.&rdquo;&nbsp; This starts always under the belly, and
you will find that the skin becomes very red and speckled.&nbsp; This
is easily remedied by the simple process of washing in lukewarm water
and rubbing with sweet oil and black sulphur.&nbsp; The same mixture
will answer for &ldquo;foot rot&rdquo; if rubbed well into the paws.&nbsp;
The general cause of this latter disease is neglect of the ferrets and
the hutches not being cleaned out regularly.</p>
<p>I think the best bedding for ferrets is good oat straw, fresh every
fortnight.&nbsp; Throw the straw in carelessly, and the ferrets will
make their own beds.&nbsp; When breeding ferrets, never go near them
more than you can help, as they are of a wild nature and liable to destroy
their young.&nbsp; When you know a Jill or bitch ferret has young, give
her a little extra good food, but don&rsquo;t interfere with the young
ones on any account, and if you want to give her a little extra bedding
put the straw in the same place as the food, and she will take it into
the sleeping place herself.&nbsp; It is advisable not to touch the young
ones for five weeks, or better still leave them until they come out
to feed themselves; and when running about, if there <!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>be
a good number, say nine or ten, in the lot, it is a good plan to remove
them into a larger place for sleeping, as young ferrets are very liable
to catch the red mange, which arises from too many being together and
sweating very much.</p>
<h3>WHEN WORKING FERRETS FOR RAT-CATCHING</h3>
<p>always work them unmuzzled.&nbsp; Make as little noise as possible,
as Rats are very bad to bolt sometimes.&nbsp; Never grab at the ferret
as it leaves the hole, nor tempt it out of the hole with a dead Rat.&nbsp;
The best way is to let the ferret come out of its own choice, and then
pick it up very quietly, for if you grab at it, it is likely to become
what we call a &ldquo;stopper;&rdquo; and never on any account force
a ferret to go into a hole.</p>
<h3>WHEN WORKING FERRETS FOR RABBIT-SHOOTING</h3>
<p>always muzzle them.&nbsp; The old-fashioned style of muzzle is, I
think, the best, that is, made with string.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t approve
of wire muzzles, as they are liable to catch against tree roots and
bits of sharp stones, and from experience I find the ferret works much
better with the string muzzle.</p>
<p>There is one way of working ferrets when rabbit-shooting which, if
followed, I think would lead to a better day&rsquo;s shooting.&nbsp;
You will often see the ferrets stick up with the <!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>rabbits.&nbsp;
Now, in most cases the gamekeeper or his man working the ferrets will
often cut open a dead rabbit and put the paunch to the burrow.&nbsp;
I quite agree as to the desirability of this to get the ferrets out,
but I say that the man using the ferrets ought never to touch the paunch,
as the ferrets will not work half so well after he has the smell of
the paunch on his hands.</p>
<p>Another bad plan is that of throwing a dead rabbit into the burrow
so that the ferret will follow it out.&nbsp; The best plan is to let
the ferret get clear of the hole, and then pick it up quietly.&nbsp;
If you will break your ferrets in in this manner you will never have
any trouble with them afterwards.</p>
<p>When ferrets are conveyed about for the purpose of rabbiting, boxes
are much better to use than bags, as the ferrets then get a better chance
of resting.&nbsp; If bags be used you disturb the ferrets&rsquo; rest
and position each time you remove one.&nbsp; Take care to observe this
and it will result in a good day&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>Always take your ferrets home as quickly as possible after a day&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>Ferrets kept only for rabbit-shooting should always be fed as soon
as the day&rsquo;s work is over, but they must not have more food till
the same time the following day.&nbsp; If fed in <!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>this
way regularly you will find that they will work very well.&nbsp; It
is also advisable to let them drink at a stream when they have worked
about three hours.</p>
<p>When ferrets have been fast in a rabbit burrow, their paws may be
full of down with scratching at the rabbits.&nbsp; Always remove this
before placing them to another burrow.&nbsp; Each time you handle the
ferret see that the muzzle is alright, and in muzzling with string great
care should be taken to remove the long hair on the snout from under
the string; otherwise the ferret may experience a tickling sensation,
and not work so well as it should; see also that the string is tied
tightly around the ferret&rsquo;s neck; if not it can easily pull off
the muzzle with its paws.</p>
<p>Whenever a ferret is severely bitten by a Rat the best course to
take immediately you get it home is to bathe the wound in clean luke-warm
water.&nbsp; See that all the dirt is removed, and then apply a few
drops of sweet oil to the wound.&nbsp; Repeat this every four hours,
until the wound is healed, but until then do not work the ferret lest
more dirt gets into the wound.&nbsp; My experience proves this to be
the best way to cure a ferret when it has received a severe Rat-bite.</p>
<p>It is also a good plan occasionally (say <!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>once
a fortnight) to skin a nice young Rat and give it to the ferret.</p>
<h3>SUITABLE DOGS.</h3>
<p>And now a word or two as to what is a good dog for waterside hunting,
or working with the ferrets.&nbsp; I recommend a cross-bred dog, but
I find that it is always better to have the pointer breed in it, whatever
other breed you get, because the pointer always has the nose or scent.&nbsp;
Pointer and Airedale would be very good, or pointer and Irish terrier.&nbsp;
I have often noticed that pure-bred dogs are not much good for hunting
in buildings or rivers.&nbsp; I have frequently seen a cross-bred dog
stand at one side of the river, and if the wind has been in his favour
he has winded his nose across the river, and I have sent him over and
he has turned a Rat out, bolted it into the water, and killed it.</p>
<p>The best precaution to take in breaking a dog to Rat-catching and
waterside hunting (especially if it be a puppy) is to never allow anybody
but yourself to have anything to do with it, it being the worst thing
possible to let a working dog have too many masters.&nbsp; Break it
in to the ferrets first, and then it is a good plan to go up the river
banks, with either a dead Rat or rabbit skin, letting the dog play with
it for a while, and then burying it about <!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>18
inches in the river bank; or you may pull up a clod and put it under,
only you must not let the dog see where you place it.&nbsp; Then take
the dog with you near to where the rat or skin is buried, and you will
soon see that the dog knows its work.&nbsp; Do this a few times, and
you will see that once the dog finds the dead Rat or the skin it will
never forget.&nbsp; The younger the dog the better, the right age to
break a puppy this way being about four or five months.&nbsp; Break
it in for taking to the water at the same time.&nbsp; If you want a
good working dog always keep it on the chain when at home, and feed
it at the same time as the ferrets, but do not over-feed it; also give
it one dose of castor oil or syrup of buckthorn every 14 days.&nbsp;
I recommend this because you never know the nasty poisonous stuff that
the dog gets on its stomach from the dirty brook and river sides.</p>
<p>Let me add that all I have written about ferrets and dogs are not
given merely from hearsay, but are the facts derived from study and
experience during 25 years of dog and ferret-keeping.</p>
<h2><!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>PART III.&nbsp;
THE HABITS OF RATS.</h2>
<p>Rats breed very quickly.&nbsp; This I have often proved by visiting
a given haunt for many years together.&nbsp; I remember an instance
in point one June, when out with dog and ferrets.&nbsp; The dog made
a set under the root of a tree.&nbsp; I put the ferret in and it bolted
eight young Rats, nearly half grown, still suckling the bitch Rat.&nbsp;
When the old Rat bolted my dog killed it, and whilst the dog was shaking
it I found she was very heavy in young again.&nbsp; This, therefore,
will prove how quickly Rats breed.</p>
<p>Another result of my observation may be of interest to my readers.&nbsp;
After removing a lot of old rubbish when ratting I came upon a nest
of just-born Rats, and, in curiosity, I cut the tails off the lot, and
then put the young Rodents back, leaving the nest undisturbed.&nbsp;
When I returned next day, I found the old Rat had carried all her young
away, and, later, I found the same tailless lot in another part of the
building, and, after disturbing them again, I found the following day
that the bitch Rat had killed every one by eating off their heads.&nbsp;
<!-- page 33--><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>This destruction of
the offspring I have witnessed on more than one occasion.&nbsp; The
old bitch Rat has always killed them in the same way by eating off their
heads.</p>
<p>I must not forget to tell you of the young Rat&rsquo;s dread of the
ferrets.&nbsp; I have often seen when the ferrets have been put in the
hole the young Rats (not many days old and their eyes yet unopened)
creep out of the hole.&nbsp; This is a proof that the smell of the ferrets
has a tendency to bolt Rats, either young or old.</p>
<p>Old Rats are very bold whilst suckling their young.&nbsp; I have
seen them very venturesome to get to water, and more eager for water
than for food.&nbsp; I have often traced their runs a long way for water,
and noticed that when crossing a field to get to a pit or river they
never walk, but are always on the run; and in the summer, when they
reach the pit, they not only drink, but often swim about.&nbsp; I have
frequently watched them swimming on a moonlight night, but they generally
go back to the buildings in the early morning, especially in the winter
months.</p>
<p>Another habit I have often noticed.&nbsp; Take a farm, or any place
where there are many Rats, and it will be always found that when a Rat
gets very old it becomes very greyish in colour and rather scabbed,
and its hair comes <!-- page 34--><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>off,
mostly on the back.&nbsp; The healthy Rats will then drive the old Rat
away, and these scabby old Rats may be caught by themselves in other
parts of the buildings; and, further, I often notice that if the ferrets
are bitten with these old Rats, they &ldquo;take bad ways.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I never put such Rats with the others nor allow my dog to kill them.&nbsp;
I would advise any gentleman having a dog he values never to let it
touch one of these old scabby Rats, as it may prove injurious to the
health of the dog.</p>
<p>It is surprising how far Rats will travel in the night.&nbsp; I have
traced their tracks from a stackyard over two or three fields to a farm
to get to their food.&nbsp; And you will always find that they have
one time for feeding, which is as soon as it is dusk, the young Rats
being the most venturesome for their food, always coming out first.</p>
<p>Rats, especially stackyard ones, are of a very clean nature.&nbsp;
You will find that after they have had their first feed they diligently
wash themselves.&nbsp; These Rats feed on nothing but good stuff, such
as wheat, corn, and meal; and from experience I find that if a man is
bitten on the hand by one of these Brown or Stack Rats it never &ldquo;takes
bad ways,&rdquo; but, if bitten by a dirty Drain Rat, then whether he
cauterises or bathes the wound is no matter, <!-- page 35--><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>it
is sure to &ldquo;take bad ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think the reason of
this is because the Drain Rat, when it cannot get anything else to eat,
exists on the worms and slugs, and this, I think, causes the teeth to
become more venomous.&nbsp; When bitten in this way blood poisoning
is very likely to ensue.&nbsp; Indeed, you must understand that the
teeth of a full-grown Rat are quite half-an-inch long, and the jaw is
very strong, so that if you are bitten on the finger it is almost sure
to penetrate to the bone.&nbsp; I have known a good many cases of blood
poisoning through Rat-bites.</p>
<p>The damage Rats can do to property, commodities, etc., is almost
incredible.&nbsp; I have had so many examples of this that I scarcely
know which to submit as illustration.&nbsp; I think the worst case I
have seen was where they gnawed a hole half way through a 2&frac14;
inch lead pipe, and often I have known them to bite through a one-inch
lead pipe.&nbsp; The worst damage is done when they get under the flag
floors of cottage houses out of the drains.&nbsp; They scratch the soil
from beneath the flags, which then sink, and the consequent stench from
the drains is abominable, jeopardising the health of the tenants.&nbsp;
I have seen a great many of these cases in the poorer parts of Manchester.&nbsp;
The damage the Rats will do <!-- page 36--><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>in
the silk and similar trades, to the goods of merchants, or in the grocery
business, is enormous, and not so much by reason of what they actually
eat as by what they carry away, which is often ten times as much as
they eat.&nbsp; I have often proved this when ferreting at a wholesale
grocery warehouse.&nbsp; When we have taken up the boards between the
laths and plaster we have found the ceiling almost full of lump sugar,
nuts, candles, etc., which have been there for years, hoarded by the
Rats.&nbsp; Now, this all means heavy loss, and that is why I say that
any business man so suffering ought to engage the services of a professional
Rat-catcher once a year in order to keep the Rats down, and catch as
many as possible before they begin breeding.</p>
<p>Another Rat habit may be noticed where the Rodents are accustomed
to have their holes and runs among flags and stones.&nbsp; If they find
any soft wood such as pine or white deal, they will nibble at it until
it is eaten through.&nbsp; I have often known them to eat right through
the legs of tables in the middle of cooking kitchens.&nbsp; This, I
think, they do simply to keep their teeth clean and in order; I have
known half-grown Rats to do the same.</p>
<p>Rats can exist a long time on herbage, if they can get nothing more
palatable.&nbsp; It is <!-- page 37--><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>a
very common thing to find Rats in the rabbit burrows when ferreting;
in fact, I have seen, not once, but many times, Rats, rabbits, and weasels
all bolt from the same burrow.&nbsp; I have also unearthed a Rat and
a rabbit together out of one single burrow.</p>
<p>Now as to keeping Rats in store cages at home.&nbsp; Look well after
them, and I think it is possible to keep them alive for quite a year;
but if you keep, say, 20 in one store cage and neglect their feeding,,
you will find that when hungry in the night they will kill the weakest
of their number and eat it, sometimes even eating two or three in one
night, leaving the skin as clean as if a man had skinned them.&nbsp;
It is always the best plan to put the Rats in different cages, according
to their sizes.&nbsp; The young ones together, the old ones together,
and the middle-aged ones together, as they keep themselves much cleaner
when thus divided, and do not fight so much as they would otherwise.&nbsp;
They must also be kept in a warm place; if not, they soon have cramp.&nbsp;
Also keep them in a dark place and see that they have plenty of water;
sprinkle them now and then with it so that they will wash themselves.&nbsp;
It is astonishing what a hungry Rat will do.&nbsp; I have seen them
in the summer at dusk run at an old hen with her chickens under her,
<!-- page 38--><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and almost as quick
as I tell it, the Rat has snatched a live chicken and run with it under
a pigsty floor.</p>
<p>I have known them to take half-grown young ducks from the water side.&nbsp;
I remember once ferreting round a pit, near a barn, and when I put my
ferret in the hole, it pulled out two dead chickens and three middle-sized
dead ducks, and behind them, not more than a yard deep in the pit bank,
was an old Rat.&nbsp; I have also known them to get into the coops where
a gamekeeper was rearing his pheasants, and to kill nine young ones
in a single night all from under the same hen.</p>
<p>Rats are also fond of eggs.&nbsp; I have read of many ways in which
Rats take eggs, but in my quarter-of-a-century&rsquo;s experience of
Ratting I never saw Rats take eggs save in one way, and that is, dragging
or rolling them along the floor with their front paws, until they get
them to the mouth of the hole.&nbsp; I remember one place where I was
ferreting.&nbsp; There was an old cellar, the door of which at the top
of the steps had to my knowledge been nailed up two or three years.&nbsp;
Out of the hen house the Rats had eaten a hole at each side of the cellar
door at the bottom.&nbsp; One day we burst open the door, went into
the cellar (where it was impossible for a hen to get whilst the <!-- page 39--><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>door
was closed) and beneath the bottom step we caught two Rats.&nbsp; On
lifting the flag at the bottom of the steps, we found 15 whole eggs,
some good and some bad, all of which I am quite satisfied the Rats had
carried down those nine stone steps!&nbsp; How they had done so I cannot
explain, but content myself with stating only the plain facts of my
own personal observation.</p>
<p>Rats are also very cunning in the water, say a pit or a river.&nbsp;
Now, a Rat can exist in water for at most about seven minutes, and you
will find when a dog is swimming after a Rat that the Rat is watching
the dog all the time, for as soon as the dog gets within a yard of the
Rat the latter will dive under water and come to the surface again about
15 yards away.&nbsp; When the dog has tired the Rat out with swimming,
you will very often see the Rat dive again and come up very quietly
and just put its nose out of the water, or rest its head on a floating
leaf.&nbsp; It is so cunning that it will remain still there, and if
the leaf or reed gives way it will come up at the water side and just
thrust out its nose to breathe.&nbsp; By this means the dog loses full
scent of the Rat.</p>
<p>I have also noticed how useful are the Rat&rsquo;s front paws and
tail.&nbsp; I have seen a Rat on the top of a swill tub at a pigsty,
when the <!-- page 40--><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>swill has
been about ten inches from the top of the tub.&nbsp; The Rat was too
cunning to jump down on the wet swill and drown, but I saw it reach
as far down the inside of the tub as possible with its front paws and
scrape the grease from around the sides!&nbsp; I have also seen the
same Rat, when unable to scrape any further down the tub sides, turn
round, clutch the top of the tub with its front paws, dip its tail into
the swill, and then gain the top of the tub and commence licking its
tail.</p>
<p>I have also tried an experiment with the same tub, which consisted
of covering the top of the wet swill with bran, which floated on the
surface, and placing a bit of lumpy swill in the middle of the bran,
in the hope that the Rat would jump on the bran in the expectation of
getting at the swill in the middle.&nbsp; However, it did not do so,
no doubt instinctively guided against the danger.</p>
<p>I have also watched Rats run round a set wire or cage trap for a
full hour.&nbsp; I have seen them go half way in and out again, look
at the bait and never touch it, but go away and never return to the
same trap that night.&nbsp; These examples show the cunning instinct
of Rats.</p>
<p>There is, however, one power that the Rat is not favoured with, and
I am afraid if they were they would be a greater pest.&nbsp; It is the
<!-- page 41--><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>ability of high jumping.&nbsp;
A Rat cannot, I think, jump higher than three feet six inches, and will
have to be very hungry before doing that to obtain food.</p>
<p>Many people may not know how fierce Rats are when fighting.&nbsp;
Let me instance.&nbsp; I have often taken, one in each hand, two good
Rats from my cage before a hundred spectators and set the Rats at each
other on the top of a table.&nbsp; To see them fight would be surprising.&nbsp;
They will fight like two bulldogs.&nbsp; When they have got a grip of
each other with their teeth I have taken away my hands, and they have
stuck and shook one another for at least half-a-minute, although you
must understand that the moment they are loose of one another they are
off if you don&rsquo;t catch them again.</p>
<p>There are several other cunning ways of Rats which I can scarcely
explain.&nbsp; One must be amongst them regularly to know their wonderful
ways and habits.&nbsp; Yet another little incident, in conclusion, may
be of interest.&nbsp; I once called at a farm where they had been threshing
a wheat stack.&nbsp; A Rat-catcher had been there but without a dog,
and when I arrived two hours afterwards my dog made a set, and commenced
scratching amongst the old chaff left at the bottom of the stack, and
to the astonishment of myself and the farmer <!-- page 42--><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>I
pulled out of the hole where the dog was scratching 73 live Rats!&nbsp;
The other Rat-catcher, who had been at the threshing all day, had caught
only 14 Rats.&nbsp; This will serve to show that a Rat-catcher must
not be without a good dog.</p>
<p>And now, respecting the ways and habits of Rats I think I have given
my readers interesting and varied illustrations of what I have seen
and experienced during my time.</p>
<h2><!-- page 43--><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>PART IV.&nbsp;
LIFE OF THE RAT-CATCHER.</h2>
<p>This work will not be complete if I do not deal with the Rat-catcher&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; The profession is a peculiar and exciting one, but all right
if pursued in the right way.&nbsp; Although the calling takes one into
dirty and obnoxious places, there is no reason why the Rat-catcher should
not always appear respectable.&nbsp; The Rat-catcher has many temptations
to dishonest conducts, for instance, when Rat-catching on a farm or
private estate where there are numerous rabbits and game.&nbsp; It looks
rather hard lines for the Rat-catcher to come off a farm with his cage
full of Rats and see rabbits running about whilst he has all the requisites
in his possession for catching them; and yet he must not touch one,
but go home and merely reflect on what a good Sunday&rsquo;s dinner
he is leaving behind.&nbsp; This I have experienced many a time, but
I have always found even from the business view-point that the old <!-- page 44--><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>advice
still remains true, &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Leaving the rabbits to themselves has always turned out to be the best,
for to take a rabbit worth a shilling, and get caught in the act, means
that you can never go on the same estate again.&nbsp; And from that
same estate you might have got 500 Rats in a year, worth four shillings
a dozen.</p>
<p>I must also put in a good word here for the gamekeepers.&nbsp; My
opinion is that if you go on a keeper&rsquo;s ground and do what is
right, you will be able to go again, for in the whole of my experience
never having carried any nets but Rat nets when on private estates,
I have the consolation of knowing that I should always be welcome on
going again to such estates.</p>
<p>Of course there are inconveniences that the Rat-catcher has to put
up with.&nbsp; Whatever engagements he takes in a town, the only time
he can catch Rats with a good result is in the night.&nbsp; On one occasion,
when going round with my bull&rsquo;s-eye lamp to examine the traps,
I was taken for a burglar by the policeman on the beat, and he doubted
me so much that he would not release me until I had shown him my cage
with Rats in and my traps set all over the place.&nbsp; Then he took
almost as much interest in the catching of Rats as myself, and also
brought in the other policemen who were <!-- page 45--><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>outside
waiting for me to attempt an escape.&nbsp; Ever after that, when I had
a night&rsquo;s engagement in any town, I always went to the police
station to tell the man on that beat where I was.</p>
<p>It behoves the Rat-catcher to be always attentive to his customers,
those, I mean, who want live Rats wherewith to try their dogs.&nbsp;
Amongst mine I have the honour to include clients of highest rank and
position, barristers, magistrates, solicitors and a host of sporting
gentry.&nbsp; If the Rat-catcher&rsquo;s efforts commend themselves
to such gentlemen, and he always maintains a respectable appearance,
he will obtain some very nice outings in the country.&nbsp; Oft-times
a party of gentlemen have sent for me in the summer, having arranged
with me to bring four or five ferrets and Ratting appliances, and we
have gone 50 miles up the country.&nbsp; They would bring their terrier
dogs, and we would hunt all along the brooks and rivers, and round the
corn and wheat fields, putting the Rats we caught into the cage, and
after lunch, taking the Rats to a meadow and coursing them with their
dogs, which I think it real good sport.&nbsp; We would put up at the
best hotels and repeat the procedure next day, very often taking a drag
or coach, and driving ten or a dozen miles farther up the country.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>I can assure my
readers that the Rat-catcher is well remunerated for the trouble he
undertakes in these cases, and moreover this is the class of people
he requires to fraternise with.&nbsp; There is always a plentiful supply
of &ldquo;refreshments&rdquo; on these outings, and I would therefore
advise the Rat-catcher not to indulge too freely.</p>
<p>The foregoing is, of course, a brief sketch of the pleasantest part
of a Rat-catcher&rsquo;s life, and to complete the picture I may as
well describe some of the other features, and the way he has to rough
it sometimes.&nbsp; Well, Rat-catchers are generally called upon to
supply Rats for the Rat coursings usually held at beerhouses, etc.,
on Saturday afternoons, which one often sees advertised.&nbsp; Now,
if he binds himself to supply a coursing at a certain date, the bills
announcing the event are printed and posted, all of which means expense.&nbsp;
Then you are bound to secure the live Rats, whatever be the weather.&nbsp;
In doing this I always followed the threshing machine to the bays and
stacks.&nbsp; (Anyone that catches Rats regularly can tell by looking
at the bays or stacks whether there are many Rats in or not.)&nbsp;
I remember many times when the men have started threshing a bay of wheat
in which were a great many Rats, and by dark they <!-- page 47--><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>have
threshed only half of the bay.&nbsp; At such times the Rat-catcher must
not leave the remaining half, no, not for half-an-hour throughout the
whole night, for if he does the Rats will run out.&nbsp; To stop the
Rats from leaving, the Rat-catcher has to lie on the top of the bay
or go about every thirty minutes and beat the bottom with sticks until
daylight, in order to keep the Rats in.&nbsp; Then, after the machine
re-starts, and the bottom of the bay is reached, the Rat-catcher will
be well paid for his trouble, for he may get, say, 150 good Rats for
the coursing, at six shillings per dozen.&nbsp; The reason I call them
good coursing Rats is because they have not been handled, and that enables
them to run well.</p>
<p>Now, when you go to these coursings (which are mostly in the colliery
districts) you will find about 60 dogs entered.&nbsp; It is the Rat-catcher&rsquo;s
business to measure and handicap the dogs, and a very unpleasant job
it is.&nbsp; He has also to be the referee at these coursings, and if
it is a &ldquo;near thing&rdquo; with two dogs running at one rat, and
you decide to award the victory to a given one, then the owner of the
other dog will probably accuse you of wrong-doing and favouritism.&nbsp;
Then is the time the Rat-catcher has to be prepared to pull off his
coat and start fighting before, <!-- page 48--><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>perhaps,
500 spectators.&nbsp; This has often occurred with me.&nbsp; This, I
can assure my readers, is what I call &ldquo;roughing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, what I have just related occurred a few years ago, but
when the Muzzling Order came into force, the authorities practically
stopped Rat coursing, for they would not let a dog run at a Rat unless
the dog was muzzled.&nbsp; This was about the worst thing that the authorities
could do for Manchester and district, for at that time I was supplying
for coursings about 100 Rats per week, and at the same time sending
50 Rats a week into Yorkshire, and all the Rats I supplied were caught
within 15 miles of Manchester.&nbsp; This in my opinion, speaks very
bad of the Muzzling Order, which I think is nothing but a farce, for
at the very time I was going ratting, dogs were muzzled in some parts
of the country but not in others.&nbsp; My opinion of dog muzzling is,
muzzle all or muzzle none.</p>
<p>You will see by what I have said respecting these coursings, etc.,
that the Rat-catcher has plenty of work to supply so many live rats,
and he has also to mix with company high and low.&nbsp; He also sometimes
experiences difficulties in travelling on the railway.&nbsp; I have
often entered an empty third-class carriage, sent my dog under the seat,
and <!-- page 49--><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>put the Rat cage
there also.&nbsp; The carriage would fill with passengers, and upon
reaching my destination I would take from under the seat my cage full
of live Rats, to the amusement of some and the disgust of others.</p>
<p>I have also entered a railway carriage with my cage of rats when
there were passengers in, one or two of whom would generally object
to live Rats being in the same compartment, and on enquiring of the
railway officials, I have found that any one travelling with live Rats
is expected to put them in the guard&rsquo;s van.</p>
<p>I have also had a few good customers in my business, one or two in
particular.&nbsp; Gentlemen have often sent me post-cards instructing
me to take six or twelve Rats to their residences.&nbsp; I would run
them out on the lawn in front of the house with their dogs, and generally
I have received good remuneration for my trouble.&nbsp; These are the
customers who should be looked well after, for they are the sportsmen
who do not consider expense, though of course there are others who are
just the opposite.</p>
<p>Further, Rat-catching is a business in which one is not called upon
to allow credit.&nbsp; It is all a ready-money trade, and as there is
not much competition, the Rat-catcher can command a good price for his
work.&nbsp; He has always one resource open to him when he has <!-- page 50--><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>finished
a job according to contract (catching say 40 or 50 Rats), should there
be a dispute about the price and the people decline to pay the bill,
then he has the expedient of letting the Rats at liberty again in the
place where he had caught them.&nbsp; Most people will pay the price
you send in rather than have the Rats turned loose again.</p>
<p>Although I am showing how the Rat-catcher can always have the advantage
of stubborn payers, I may as well assure my readers that in all my experience
such an occurrence as the above has never happened with me, simply because
I always make my arrangements beforehand, which course I always find
the best and most satisfactory all round.</p>
<p>Another matter I may mention.&nbsp; If any one could find out a sure
way of catching Rats so that he could give a guarantee to clear large
buildings, my opinion is that he would make a fortune in a very short
time; for I know firms in Manchester alone that would pay almost any
amount to be rid of the Rats; not only because of what they consume,
but more for the damage they do to their goods.</p>
<p>I have referred to the Rat-catcher obtaining good pay.&nbsp; The
reason he commands such a big price for his work at the present time
is because there is not much sale for live Rats.&nbsp; <!-- page 51--><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The
trade is not what it was some years ago when Rat-pits were allowed.&nbsp;
I think it was one of the worst things they ever did for this country
when the authorities stopped the Rat pits, for when Rat killing was
allowed in pits, it was a common thing for a Rat-catcher to receive
an order for 100 Rats, all to be killed at one time; then the Rat-catcher
would get the Rats and wherever he got them from he was ridding that
district of a nuisance.&nbsp; But when the authorities stopped Rat-pits
and Rat-coursing, the consequence was that the Rat-catcher left the
Rats to breed in thousands.&nbsp; Rats being vermin, I don&rsquo;t see
why they should not be killed 50 or 100 at a time in the pit, but the
Humane Society maintain that it is cruelty to dogs to put them in a
pit with a lot of Rats.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see where the cruelty comes
in, but from what I have seen of Rat-pits during my time I approve of
them, and I think if they were in existence again there would be a clearing
of many thousands of Rats.&nbsp; Some 15 or 20 years since, I supplied
400 Rats in one week, all to be killed in Rat-pits.</p>
<p>Many of my readers may not understand what a Rat-pit is, and so I
will just give an outline as well as I can.</p>
<p>The Rat-pit is of circular construction, say ten feet diameter, and
about four feet six <!-- page 52--><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>inches
deep, the sides being perfectly smooth to prevent the rats climbing
up and making their escape.&nbsp; A certain number of Rats are placed
in the pit according to the arrangements made with the owner of the
dog.&nbsp; Then the dog is put in the pit with the rats to kill them,
which a good dog does very quickly.</p>
<p>The reason the pit is built circular is so that the Rats will keep
running round, for if it were square they would all run in a corner,
one on the other, and then the dog would have no difficulty in killing
them.&nbsp; It is better to have the pit fairly deep; if not, the rats
might escape.</p>
<p>I think the best dog, within my recollection, that I have seen was
a bull and fox terrier, which killed 40 good Rats in three minutes and
21 seconds.&nbsp; I have read and heard of dogs doing better feats,
but I am only writing of what I have myself seen.&nbsp; I may say that
the records for Rat-killing in Rat-pits are held by a dog called Jacko,
which killed 200 Rats in 14 minutes and 37 seconds, and 1,000 Rats in
less than one hour and 40 minutes.</p>
<p>The Rat-catcher has also some very dirty jobs to do sometimes.&nbsp;
Often he has to go under all sorts of cellar floors, both wet and dry,
but the majority of places are very wet and dirty, for the Rats nearly
always come out <!-- page 53--><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of
some filthy drain, and very often near a water-closet, the abominable
smell arising from these places being sufficient to cause a fever.</p>
<p>I remember being once employed at a hospital, and I was paid at the
rate of 5s. per visit for trapping Rats.&nbsp; Well, I found that 5s.
per visit did not pay me (I had about 120 traps set all over the place),
so I went before the committee and requested 8s. per night.&nbsp; The
committee said they thought 5s. per visit was enough, and one or two
of them said they thought 8s. per night was above a Rat-catcher&rsquo;s
pay.&nbsp; Now, as I was not depending on that particular job at the
time, I turned round and told them what I thought.&nbsp; I told them
I considered Rat-catching was a skilled occupation, and I also offered
any of them a five-pound note if they would only follow me under the
floors at midnight, not to speak of taking the live Rats out of the
traps in the dark; but I can assure you that none of these gentlemen
would venture to undertake the task.</p>
<p>Now, if any of these gentlemen had to do this a few times they would
not refuse to pay the Rat-catcher the sum he asks, viz., 8s. per night.</p>
<p>I remember more than once in big places <!-- page 54--><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>such
as bonding warehouses, when I have been under the floors, my candle
or lamp has gone out through being knocked over with grabbing at Rats,
and I have not had a match in my pocket, and have had to grope about
in the dark trying to find the trap-door where I have got under the
floors, more often than not putting my hand in a set trap.&nbsp; It
would be of no use shouting for a light simply because I have been alone.&nbsp;
It is always better for a Rat-catcher to have assistance for night work,
but I have done it myself very often.</p>
<p>Now, the expenses of travelling come very heavy sometimes, for wherever
the Rat-catcher goes he always has to pay railway fare for himself and
his dog.</p>
<p>Another thing I must tell you.&nbsp; Often when I have gone to inspect
a small building I have found that there were a great many Rats in,
but I have also known, after inspecting the place, that they have all
come from the one place, out of the drain.&nbsp; Well, if I have contracted
to do this job for a lump sum, I could easily clear this place and not
catch an odd Rat, simply by ferreting them all back into the sewer in
the daytime, and then making it good; but in most of these cases they
do not like to pay your bill because you have caught no Rats.&nbsp;
Still, you have <!-- page 55--><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>driven
them all down the drains, and after making the drain good they cannot
get back again into the building.</p>
<p>Now, in a case like this I always trap them two or three nights and
catch a few, just to give satisfaction to those engaging me.</p>
<p>Sometimes gentlemen will write inviting me to meet them at a certain
farm, and bring my ferrets and a good supply of nets, alleging that
there are &ldquo;hundreds of Rats in the stacks.&rdquo;&nbsp; I just
relate this to indicate how anyone not regularly amongst Rats can easily
be deceived as to their numbers, for a couple of Rats on the thatch
of a stack, especially when they have young ones, will probably have
twelve holes eaten in the thatch and underneath the stack, and anyone
not understanding their habits would think there were a lot of Rats
in it.</p>
<p>And it is much the same with workpeople; if they chance to see two
or three Rats at once, they will say there are &ldquo;scores&rdquo;
of them.&nbsp; You would also be surprised to see the awful dread that
tenants have of the Rat-catcher in private houses.&nbsp; When ferreting
these places they think that if a Rat-catcher has once put his ferrets
under the floor they will never see another Rat in the place; but depend
upon it they are very bad to catch in these places.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>I have often had
much trouble respecting houses, warehouses, etc., to know whose duty
it would be to pay the Rat-catcher for his work, the landlord&rsquo;s
or the tenant&rsquo;s, but I think that the landlord should pay.&nbsp;
I have had many engagements to catch Rats in newly-built houses before
they were tenanted.&nbsp; The time the Rats get into these places is
whilst the workmen are putting the drains in the back yards, leaving
the drains open at nights.&nbsp; Thence the Rats come out and get under
the floors, sometimes having to stop there, too, simply because the
next day the joiners board up the floors and thus block the Rats in
underneath, and then the Rats can always get into the kitchens up the
back of the fireplace.&nbsp; Most property owners would do well to take
note of this fact.</p>
<p>I must tell my readers, especially those having large shops, etc.,
that it is a good plan, if possible, to turn off the gas and water every
night and week-end, for I have seen a good many cases where the Rats
in the night-time have eaten through a water-pipe, and the place has
been flooded by morning.&nbsp; It is just the same with a gas-pipe,
and my opinion is that it is quite possible for fires to be caused by
Rats in the night-time.&nbsp; Rats are very fond of nibbling and scratching
at soft wood, and <!-- page 57--><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>it
would be an easy matter at a grocer&rsquo;s shop for a Rat to bite or
scratch through the package of a gross of matches and ignite them, and
the same cause may prove disastrous with any other inflammable goods.</p>
<p>Respecting the conveyance of live Rats, the Rat-catcher should always
be particular to have good strong cages and bags, because if he had
a number of Rats in an unserviceable bag which happened to break open
at a railway station or in the street, I think he could be summoned
for the damage the escaped Rats might do.&nbsp; Still, I have not in
my time had or heard of a case of this sort.</p>
<p>Speaking of bags, a good many people seem to think that if a man
puts his hand into a bagful of Rats they will bite him, but I can assure
you that a child could do the same thing and not be bitten.&nbsp; Should
there be only two or three in the bag, then they will bite, but not
in the event of there being a good number.&nbsp; The same rule applies
to Rats stored in a cage, where there is open daylight&mdash;if there
be 40 or 50 Rats together, it is then the habit of the Rats for all
to cling together, and they will let you handle them anyway if only
you will have sufficient courage.</p>
<p>It is very good sport for gentlemen who want a good day&rsquo;s outing
to go to farms when <!-- page 58--><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>threshing
is on, and also to go hunting and ferreting round the corn and wheat
fields, and I think many sporting gentlemen who have not seen such sport
would indulge in it freely after they had once witnessed it.&nbsp; I
think it is much better and healthier sport than rabbit-shooting, especially
in the summer when the farmers are cutting their corn and wheat.</p>
<p>When catching Rats as a regular pursuit, one is surprised at the
queer places in which he finds them.&nbsp; I recollect ferreting seven
full-sized Rats from under the floor of a built dog kennel not above
four yards square, where a large mastiff and a terrier dog slept every
night, only a &frac34;-inch board dividing them from the Rats, and the
Rats having eaten holes through the boards in the kennel!&nbsp; I have
also found at an out-house an old bitch Rat and nine young ones in an
old tin trunk without a lid.&nbsp; I have also caught Rats and taken
young ones out of the nest from under railway sleepers where trains
have been running and shunting operations carried on every day.&nbsp;
And I have even taken old and young ones in their nest from a pile of
Cheshire cheese, at a wholesale cheese and bacon factor&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>And mentioning cheese in this connection reminds me that once I discovered
that Rats had scratched and eaten a hole direct through <!-- page 59--><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
bottom lot of cheese in a pile which had only been there three weeks.</p>
<p>A word or two about what a Rat will do with a ferret.&nbsp; I have
often seen a Rat run a ferret out of the hole, and then wait with its
head out of the hole until the ferret has come to it again.&nbsp; I
remember once ferreting at a hencote, and put the ferret behind the
hen nest, whereupon the Rat attacked the ferret, which then jumped back
and died in five minutes, the Rats having given only one bite behind
the ferret&rsquo;s ear!&nbsp; Of course this is a very rare occurrence.&nbsp;
True, I have had many ferrets killed by Rats in my time, but it has
always occurred through the poisonous bite first swelling and then &ldquo;taking
bad ways,&rdquo; the ferret dying in probably a week or so.</p>
<p>You must understand that if you put a Rat and a ferret together in
a tub the ferret would kill the Rat in nine cases out of ten, the nature
of the Rat being to get away from the ferret if possible; but if it
cannot it will fight, and I think a Rat, for its size, is of a very
vicious nature, for I have often seen when trying a puppy at killing
a Rat in a pit, that a game Rat will run the puppy all round the pit.&nbsp;
The best way to try a pup to kill a Rat is to draw the teeth of the
first Rat it secures for sometimes if a pup gets a severe bite from
a Rat <!-- page 60--><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>it will never
look at another.&nbsp; It is a very bad plan to let a pup play with
a Rat too much, for this causes the pup never to put a hard mouth on
the Rat.&nbsp; When this latter occurs it is the best plan not to allow
the same pup to see another Rat until it is a month or two older.&nbsp;
If you will take care and trouble with a pup you can bring it up to
your own liking, and to do anything you want.&nbsp; I have worked seven
years with a curly-coated retriever bitch, and when ferreting a brook
she would stand in the water and catch the Rats that escaped from the
nets into the brook and bring them to me alive in her mouth.&nbsp; I
have sold hundreds of Rats she has caught in this manner, and to show
you how the dogs can be brought up with the ferrets I need only mention
that this bitch would lie down and let two ferrets kill a Rat on the
curly coat of her back.</p>
<p>Farmers know too well of the many restless nights the cows and horses
experience through Rats.&nbsp; I have seen when trapping all night at
a farm the Rats running over the cows and horses whilst sleeping: and
when horses have been working in the field all day they want better
rest in the night.&nbsp; I have known when farmers would not let the
Rat-catcher ferret their buildings gratis, simply because they have
<!-- page 61--><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>a few hens sitting.&nbsp;
They don&rsquo;t consider that when the hens have hatched the eggs the
Rats will take the chickens.&nbsp; Whenever a farmer has refused to
let me ferret at his farm I have passed that farm ever afterwards.&nbsp;
To show you the different dispositions of farmers I have met, I may
mention that when once ferreting at a farm, we caught nine rats and
lost the ferret, and two days afterwards the ferret was found on the
farm, and I sent for it, but the farmer demanded two shillings of me
for the ferret&rsquo;s keep.&nbsp; This same man I may add farmed about
two hundred acres.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other farmers just the opposite, who will not
only pay you for your trouble, but take great interest in helping you
to catch the Rats.&nbsp; I relate these facts and incidents to show
you the contrast in the disposition of different people one meets in
this business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Rat-catcher&rsquo;s life is one of the worst
if he looks well after his business, for he has a few advantages over
other occupations.&nbsp; In the first place, he is his own master, and
need only doff his coat when he chooses, there being for him no such
summons to work as a factory bell.&nbsp; And if he fancies a day&rsquo;s
outing in the country he can always take his dog and ferrets with him,
and make a <!-- page 62--><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>day&rsquo;s
pleasure into a remunerative business, by reason of the income from
the Rats, and I find from experience that the best friends he has are
his dog and ferrets, if he will look well after them and treat them
kindly, for I think that a Rat-catcher in the country without a good
dog might walk over scores of Rats and never know they were there, so
you will see that his dog is chiefly what he has to trust to.</p>
<p>And now, in conclusion, let me express the hope that this book will
prove instructive, entertaining, and profitable to my readers, inasmuch
as I have endeavoured to make it so to the best of my ability and within
the somewhat limited scope and sphere of a Rat-catcher&rsquo;s calling.&nbsp;
Of course, I might have made the narrative portion of the book more
startling and exciting, had I drawn upon my imagination, but I have
thought it best to adhere to cold fact and actual experience.</p>
<h2><!-- page 63--><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>HINTS ON RABBIT
SHOOTING.</h2>
<p>Always have your gun made at your gunmaker&rsquo;s to your own liking.</p>
<p>Always be prepared for the worst of weather, and be sure to have
good strong boots.</p>
<p>Never have your gun on full cock while walking about, especially
whilst going through a fence.</p>
<p>Never stand too close to a burrow, and don&rsquo;t be too eager to
shoot.</p>
<p>Always have your gun pointed upwards to the clouds or down to the
ground.</p>
<p>Never shoot at a rabbit as it sits on the top of the hole, or you
might shoot the ferret.&nbsp; Always stand so that all the shooters
can see one another.</p>
<p>Never remove from where the gamekeeper places you.</p>
<p>Never have your gun barrels up while it is raining.</p>
<p>When you go out in the country always provide yourself with refreshments
before starting.</p>
<p>If you miss an easy shot don&rsquo;t blame the gun.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too excited, and get well on the rabbits before you
pull.</p>
<p>If the keeper&rsquo;s dog is retrieving rabbits never attempt to
take one from it.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
